For the purposes of syntax highlighting and colouring and intellisense is it possible to treat other extensions (tpl, master, etc) as HTML?

I know it's possible on a file by file basis by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+P and selecting "Change Language Mode" BUT I want it to work off file extension, and not have to redo it every time I open a new file.

I also know it's possible for some languages by editing the json files in the plugins directory, BUT there doesn't seem to be one for HTML.

There is a setting files.associations that can be used to assign file patterns to languages. For example:

"files.associations": {
  "*.tpl": "html",
  "*.master": "html"
}
